You can work with compressed files and folders in the same way that you work with uncompressed files and folders. You can also combine several files into a single compressed folder, making it easier to share a group of files, since you only need to attach one folder to an eâ€‘mail message instead of several files.</p><h3>To compress a file or folder</h3><p align="justify"><ol><li>Locate the file or folder that you want to compress.</li><li>Right-click the file or folder, point to Send To, and then click Compressed (zipped) Folder.<br/> A new compressed folder is created. To rename it, right-click the folder, click Rename, and then type the new name. </li></ol></p><h3>To extract files or folders from a compressed folder</h3><p align="justify"><ol><li>Locate the compressed folder that you want to extract files or folders from.</li><li>Do one of the following: <ul><li>To extract a single file or folder, double-click the compressed folder to open it. Then, drag the file or folder from the compressed folder to a new location.</li><li>To extract the entire contents of the compressed folder, right-click the folder, click Extract All, and then follow the instructions.</li></ul></li></ol></p><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><p  align="justify"><ul><li>If you add encrypted files to a compressed folder, the files will be unencrypted when extracted, which might result in unintentional disclosure of personal or sensitive information. For that reason, you should avoid compressing encrypted files.</li><li>Some types of files, like JPEG pictures, are already highly compressed. If you compress several JPEG pictures into a folder, the total size of the folder will be about the same as the original collection of pictures because the JPEG file format is compressed to begin with.</li><li>If you have already created a compressed folder and you want to add a new file or folder to it, drag the files you want to add to the compressed folder.</li></ul></p><hr /><small>By <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Compress-and-uncompress-files-zip-files">Microsoft</a></small></body></html>
